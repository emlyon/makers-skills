            <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://researchdesignreview.com/2015/06/28/interview-guide-development-a-4-stage-funnel-approach/" rel="noopener noreferrer">funnel approach</a> in interview means asking broad, general questions first, then leading in to more specific, tougher questions.</p>

            <section class="info">
                <p>Funnel consists of four basic steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Introduction</strong><br> Introduce yourself, briefly explain the purpose of the test and allow the participant(s) to comment or ask questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>General information related to the topic</strong><br> Query the tester with general questions. Talk about his habits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavior related to particular issues</strong><br> Ask him to express himself on your application, product or service. Feel free to use the prototype for this part.</li>
                    <li><strong>Constructive suggestions for improvement</strong><br> Ask him how you could improve your prototype</li>
                </ol>
            </section>





            <h3>Project</h3>

            <p>Prepare the user test of your application, product or service:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Create your Hackmd template</strong> from <a href="https://hackmd.io/BjqhJy6RQZ6YkZwE-x-osQ?both" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this template</a>
                <li><strong>Redact your qualitative interview guide</strong> with at least 10 questions following the funnel approach on your Hackmd template.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Realise at least 5 tests</strong> with different users filling your template: the pre-testing part, the user scenarios testing part and the qualitative testing part.</li>
                <li>After each user test, <strong>complete your testing analysis</strong>.</li>
                <li>Don't forget to <strong>improve your prototype</strong> thanks to the valuable feedback received.</li>
            </ol>

            <section class="info">
                <p>In order to be able to compare the results of your tests, you have to ask the same questions to the testers. Your interview should not last more than an hour. And don't forget, your tester must speak 80% of the time.</p>
            </section>

            <h3>Resources</h3>

            <p>To <strong>create a new Hackmd from the template</strong>, you have to login, then click on "menu" and choose "save as template" like in the video just below.</p>
            <section class="info">
                <p>You can use your GitHub account to login on Hackmd. If you don't have a GitHub account, now is the time to <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up</a>!</p>

            <h3>Definitions</h3>

            <p><strong>User testing </strong>refers to a technique used in the design process to evaluate a product, feature or prototype with real users. There are several reasons why you might want to undergo usability testing, the most common is that it allows the design team to identify friction in a user experience they are designing, so that it can be addressed before being built or deployed. Identifying any issues early reduces the longer term cost.</p>
