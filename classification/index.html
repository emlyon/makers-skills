            <h1>Intro to classification with MobileNet</h1>

            <p>Are you ready to <strong>discover classification with <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MobileNet</a></strong>? In this module, you will <strong>create your own image classification application</strong>! A few years ago, being able to automatically detect the content of a picture was <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1425:_Tasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">science fiction</a>, now you can do it easily on a smartphone!</p>

            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning</a> is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, it's a research domain that develops algorithms, called <strong>models</strong>, which "learns" from datas instead of classical algorithm which implements a set of predefined rules. The more (quality) datas you give to the algorithm, to more accurate it gets (to a certain extend).</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfj6yaYE86U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supervised Learning</a> is a subfield of Machine Learning, it's a type of models where your training datasets includes both inputs and outputs. It means that you have a first set of datas (the training dataset) where you know the expected output(s) and you want the model to be able to extrapolate and predict a new output from data it has never encountered. The opposite is Unsupervised Learning, when you're trying to make sense of a dataset without knowing the expected output (for example finding similarities in a client database).</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classification</a> is a subfield of Supervised Learning, where the expected output is discrete (think different categories, or yes/no). The opposite, when the output is continuous (a number), is called regression.</li>
                <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MobileNets</a> are a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py5byOOHZM8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convolutional Neural Networks</a>, that are made to do image recognition tasks on low-latency and low-power application (embedded or mobile for example)</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.image-net.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ImageNet</a>is an image database of nearly 15 million images ordered by categories.. that's why we can use them to train classification models! It's also the name of different machine learning competitions (see <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> for example)</li>
            </ul>

            <section class="info">
                <p>Keep in mind that with MobileNet you are only scratching the surface of what can be done with classification. As soon as you see a model that outputs a category, a yes/no answer or an action to do it's a classification!</p>
