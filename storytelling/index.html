            <p>techniques of storytelling that you should use:</p>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>The hero's journey</strong></summary>

                <p>This is the most commonly used technique to tell a story. It unfolds according to the five classic steps of the narrative schema:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The initial situation: a known and familiar world.</li>
                    <li>The crisis or disruptive element: a drama or plot.</li>
                    <li>The events: the twists and turns that the hero will experience.</li>
                    <li>The resolution: the key to resolving the crisis.</li>
                    <li>The final situation: the outcome and the end.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjp-iLIwVK8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lion King</a><br>Everything is fine in a known and familiar world. But the lion king, the father, dies. Simba crosses unknown territories with supporters and opponents. His adventure will lead him to develop and accept who he is. Back at home, he will become the lion king.</p>

                <section class="info">
                    <p><strong>This technique is good for:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>projecting your audience into the adventure</li>
                        <li>showing interest in taking risks</li>
                        <li>explaining how you learned certain things</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>The mountain structure</strong></summary>

                <p>Here, it is a drama with action that rises (we believe we are coming out of it), that rises again (we believe we are coming out of it), and that rises again to a point of outcome that echoes the lessons of the earlier trials. We generally find:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The initial situation: a description of the location, the scenery, the characters.</li>
                    <li>A series of obstacles: increasingly intense challenges up to the highest point.</li>
                    <li>The final situation: the climax leads to the conclusion of the story.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56c1Leui2TE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bref j’ai pris le métro</a><br>The protagonist undergoes a series of tests before arriving at a key moment when everything changes.</p>

                <section class="info">
                    <p><strong>This technique is good for:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>showing how you have overcome a series of obstacles</li>
                        <li>captivating your audience</li>
                        <li>offering a powerful emotional conclusion</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>Nested loops</strong></summary>

                <p>The nested loop structure is a storytelling technique where three narrative schemas are intertwined. The message you want to convey is at the heart of the story, the first story to begin will be the last one to end. This gives a narrative schema of this type:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Initial situation 1</li>
                    <li>Initial situation 2</li>
                    <li>Initial situation 3</li>
                    <li><strong>A trigger, events, resolution</strong></li>
                    <li>Final situation 3</li>
                    <li>Final situation 2</li>
                    <li>Final situation 1</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TedX of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a><br>She uses several intertwined stories to illustrate the danger of a single story.</p>

                <section class="info">
                    <p><strong>This technique is good for:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>explaining the process that helped you to succeed</li>
                        <li>using an analogy to explain a concept</li>
                        <li>showing how you acquired skills / learned particular information</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>The wave structure</strong></summary>

                <p>The wave structure moves backwards and forwards between the initial situation and the final situation: <em>"This is what is not working today, and this is what I am proposing to fix the problem"</em> and so on. This gives a narrative schema of this type:</p>

                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li>1. The initial situation and the problem</li>
                    <li>2. The element of resolution and the desired purpose</li>
                    <li>1. The initial situation and the problem</li>
                    <li>3. The element of resolution and the desired purpose</li>
                    <li>1. The initial situation and the problem</li>
                    <li>4. The element of resolution and the desired purpose</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ryy7eP0kks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Luther King's <em>"I have a dream"</em></a><br> Nancy Duarte, a graphic designer, who has made graphical comparisons between the speeches of Steve Jobs and Martin Luther King, illustrates this curved wave structure very well. You can watch her TedX <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nYFpuc2Umk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
                </p>

                <section class="info">
                    <p><strong>This technique is good for:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>pushing an audience to act</li>
                        <li>creating hope</li>
                        <li>getting help, support</li>
                    </ul>

            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>In media res</strong></summary>
                <p>This is when you start your story at the heart of the action before creating a flashback to explain how you got there. This gives a narrative schema of this type:</p>

                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li>2. The events: be careful not to reveal everything</li>
                    <li>1. The trigger element</li>
                    <li>3. The resolution</li>
                    <li>4. The final situation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyR-K2CZIHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TedX by Zak Ebrahim</a><br>In this video, he explains that he is "the son of a terrorist" and invites you to discover how he has dealt with this.</p>

                <section class="info">
                    <p><strong>This technique is good for:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>capturing the audience's interest from the beginning</li>
                        <li>arousing curiosity</li>
                        <li>focusing on an important moment in your history</li>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>Converging ideas</strong></summary>

                <p>This technique promotes an idea by showing how several ways of reasoning converge to arrive at that idea, or how several stories have come to the same conclusion. The narrative schema is similar to that of nested loops, but it is the element of resolution or final situation that is common. This gives a narrative schema of this type:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>initial situation, trigger, events 1</li>
                    <li>initial situation, trigger, events 2</li>
                    <li>initial situation, trigger, events 3</li><br>
                    <li><strong>common resolution and final situation for 1, 2 & 3</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlDWRZ7IYqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Bohannon and the Black Label movement</a></p>

                <section class="info">
                    <p><strong>This technique is good for:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>promoting an idea by showing its universality</li>
                        <li>showing how links have been formed around a project, an idea</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>The false start</strong></summary>

                <p>This narrative diagram is useful for recounting a failure where you have been forced to go back several times. It is ideal for talking about what you learned from this failure, or even how you fared the second time. The premise here is to establish the idea that obstacles will be overcome, which means starting from the beginning, circumventing a difficulty and starting all over again until the final situation is reached. This gives a narrative schema of this type:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The initial situation</li>
                    <li>The trigger element</li>
                    <li>The events</li>
                    <li>A failed resolution</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The trigger element seen differently</li>
                        <li>The events</li>
                        <li>A failed resolution</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The trigger element seen differently</li>
                            <li>The events</li>
                            <li>A resolution</li>
                            <li>The final situation</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <summary><strong>The petal structure</strong></summary>

                <p>The petal structure allows you to organise several stories around a central concept. It is a useful technique if you have several stories to tell that do not necessarily have anything in common with each other, or if you want to reveal information that is related to your central concept. This gives a narrative schema of this type.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>An initial situation</li>
                    <li>The trigger element</li>
                    <li>The events</li>
                    <li>The resolution</li>
                    <li>A final situation</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An initial situation</li>
                        <li>The trigger element</li>
                        <li>The events</li>
                        <li>The resolution</li>
                        <li>The same final situation</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An initial situation</li>
                            <li>The trigger element</li>

            <h3>Definitions</h3>

            <p><strong>Storytelling</strong> is the activity of telling or writing stories. Before written writing, everything was done orally. Man has always used and loved stories, that's why storytelling is a powerful tool to get a message across.</p>

            <section class="info">
                <p>Neuroscience has proven that we have many forms of intelligence. In particular, we know that we have an emotional intelligence that is the counterpart of rationality. To reach an audience, storytelling involves both of these intelligences.</p>
            </section>

            <p><strong>There are 4 ingredients to build a story:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Facts</strong>. Avoid distracting your audience and wondering what you are talking to them about instead of listening to your story.</li>
                <li><strong>Argument</strong>. What we rely on. Why is the story interesting, relevant?</li>
                <li><strong>Action</strong>. Put yourself in the shoes of the person who reads or listens or watches. History is made for the other, not for the author. Something must happen, a tension, an issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotions</strong>. Breathe, make people react, entertain, provoke, touch.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>The cornerstone of storytelling communication:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The spectator identifies with the characters: <strong>mimesis</strong> (identification)</li>
                    <li>The spectator lives his impulses by proxy: <strong>catharsis</strong> (purgation)</li>
                    <li>The spectator has empathy for his heroes: <strong>aïsthesis</strong> (sympathy)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The <strong>storyline</strong> is a message that you write, understandable by anyone, which explains in one sentence with three clauses: the what (the idea, the angle of attack), the how (the implementation), the to generate what (the objective to be achieved or the challenge to be taken up).</p>

            <section class="info">
                <p>The Storyline is just for you, it is a guide to help you write your story in a coherent way.</p>
            </section>

            <p>
                <strong>The actors of a story:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The subject</strong>. This is the hero's objective. The target must identify himself (mimesis, catharsis).</li>
                    <li><strong>The object</strong>. This is the goal to be achieved, it may be different from the hero's quest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Opponents</strong>. This is what hinders, what hinders the achievement of the hero's goal (subject). <em>They are the most interesting characters in a story. They allow the hero to demonstrate his performance, agility or intelligence. They are essential to the construction of a story but must not be invincible, otherwise they discourage readers.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Adjuvants</strong>. These are the aids that the hero finds to carry out his mission.</li>
                    <li><strong>The hero</strong>. The only one who can find the solution, the hero will have to make the journey on his own.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
