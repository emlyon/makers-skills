            <p>Prototype a Traffic Light Trigger based on circuits and code from "Hello Arduino", "Blinking Leds" and "Using Button" by creating a circuit with 3 LEDs (one red, one orange, one green) and one button. <strong>The program has to fullfil the following scenario:</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li>On boot, the red LED should be turned on, the orange and green ones should be turned off.</li>
                <li>When the button is pressed, the red one turns off and the green one turns on for a few seconds.</li>
                <li>Then, the green one turns off and orange turns on for 1 second.</li>
                <li>Finally, orange turns off and red turns on, until the button is pressed again.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Definitions</h3>

            <p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arduino</a> originally started as a research project at the Interaction Design Institute of Ivrea (Italy) in the early 2000s. <strong>The first Arduino board was introduced in 2005</strong> to help design students (who had no previous experience in electronics or microcontroller programming) to create working prototypes connecting the physical world to the digital world. Since then it has become a popular electronics prototyping tool.</p>

            <p><strong>Arduino is an <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source hardware</a> and software ecosystem.</strong> The company offers a range of software tools, hardware platforms and documentation enabling almost anybody to be creative with technology. Arduino boards are able to read inputs (light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message) and turn it into an output (activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online).</p>

            <p><strong>A worldwide community of makers</strong> (students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals) has gathered around this open-source platform, and their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike. The community helps debug the code, writes examples, creates tutorials and supports other users on <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the forums</a>. <strong>The openness and ease-of-use of the project</strong> has led to mass adoption of micro-controller based electronics projects and was a catalyst in the creation of the <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maker Movement</a>.</p>
