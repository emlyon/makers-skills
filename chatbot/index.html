            <h3>Project</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Start by creating an account on <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM Cloud</a> and create a <strong>Watson Assistant</strong> resource as shown in the video.</li>
                <div class="bs-only">
                    <li>Now create your own chatbot, it should contain at least <strong>two entities</strong> (excluding system entities) and <strong>two intents</strong>. You’re free to write it in English or in French! It’s up to you to choose what kind of questions it should be able to answer. Be creative!</li>
                </div>

                <div class="not-on-bs">
                    <li>Now create your own chatbot by using entities, intents and the dialog flow. Don't hesitate to use the system entities and intents to detect complex user inputs. Be creative!</li>
                </div>
            </ol>

            <section class="info">

            <h3>Definitions</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>A chatbot, or conversational agent, is <strong>a computer program that interacts with users using conversation</strong>, via text or audio.</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Turing Test</a>, is a famous <strong>test of a machine ability to show an intelligent behaviour</strong>. It is based on the idea that if a human is unable to determine if they are speaking to an human or a computer while speaking to a conversationnal agent, then the agent is deemed "intelligent". <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan Turing</a> himself, gave some limitation to the test and even if nowadays some programs are able to pass the Turing Test, we are still far from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial General Intelligence</a>.</li>
